# 🌌 Magnetic Flux Density Visualization

This project visualizes the magnetic field distribution generated by an array of parallel traces using the Biot-Savart law, allowing users to explore magnetic flux density patterns across a grid. The visualization offers insights into how spacing and trace count influence the field distribution.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** for calculations
- **NumPy** for array management
- **Matplotlib** for visualizing magnetic fields

## 📊 Features

1. **Dynamic Trace Parameters** – Adjust trace spacing and count.
2. **Field Visualization** – View magnetic field as a heatmap.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python magnetic_flux_density.py
   ```
2. A heatmap of the magnetic field will display, showing field intensity across a grid based on user-defined parameters.
